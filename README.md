## ✅ Tasks Completed

### 1️⃣ **Query Classifier using SLM (Small Language Model)**
- Classified user queries into categories: `SMALLER_MODEL` vs. `BIGGER_MODEL`
- Created synthetic query datasets
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Model used: Logistic Regression

### 2️⃣ **Car Price Prediction**
- Predicted resale price of used cars based on features like fuel type, year, km driven, etc.
- Performed data cleaning, visualization, and model training
- Model used: Random Forest Regressor
- Serialized model using `pickle` for deployment

### 3️⃣ **Phishing & Fraud Detection**
- Classified URLs as `phishing` or `legitimate` using a dataset with lexical features
- Conducted feature engineering & visual analysis
- Model used: XGBoost Classifier
- Accuracy achieved: ~96%

### 4️⃣ **Diabetes Prediction using ML**
- Predicted the likelihood of diabetes based on medical attributes like glucose level, BMI, age, etc.
- Applied preprocessing techniques like handling zero values and scaling
- Trained and evaluated models including Logistic Regression and Random Forest
